Part 1

1.) True
2.) False
3.) Sal is not part of the select statement so it is an invalid line. 
	sal is an invalid name for a field and must be replaced by salary.  
	The X 12 is invalid and must be replaced by a *12.
	To rename the salary*12 column to annual salary, the correct field should be "ANNUAL SALARY".
	Salary*12 should also be in parathases so that the alias name takes effect.
4.) DESCRIBE departments
5.) 	SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, LAST_NAME, JOB_ID, HIRE_DATE AS STARTDATE
	from EMPLOYEES
6.) It worked correctly.
7.) SELECT DISTINCT job_id
	FROM EMPLOYEES
8.)SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID AS "Emp #", LAST_NAME AS "Employee", JOB_ID AS "Job", HIRE_DATE AS "Hire Date"
	FROM EMPLOYEES
9.)SELECT LAST_NAME || ' ' || JOB_ID AS "Employee and Title"
	FROM EMPLOYEES	
10.)SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID ||','|| FIRST_NAME || ',' || LAST_NAME || ',' || EMAIL || ',' || PHONE_NUMBER || ',' || HIRE_DATE || ',' || JOB_ID || ',' || SALARY || ',' || COMMISSION_PCT || ',' || DEPARTMENT_ID AS "THE_OUTPUT"
